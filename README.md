## About  
KirunaNX is a example for modding Splatoon 3 using ImGui-NVN.  
kirunaNX is an experimental mod menu framework designed for Splatoon 3 on Nintendo Switch. It provides a flexible, developer-focused foundation for creating and integrating custom tools and debugging utilities and much more using NVN, the Switchâ€™s native GPU rendering interface.  
You can customize the included example project by directly modifying the source code. This example serves as a starting point, demonstrating how to initialize NVN, render UI elements in-game, and much more. Try it out!
